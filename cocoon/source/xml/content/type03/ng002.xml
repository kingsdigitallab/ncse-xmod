			 asylum seekers an economic advantage to the UK?</head> 
		  <p>There has been recent recognition in the UK, and the rest of the
			 industrialised world, of the increasing reliance on economic migration to fill
			 skills gaps and compensate for the declining indigenous population and an
			 adverse ratio of people of wage earning age to the rest of the
			 population.<note>See, for example, the 
				<xref url="http://www.eng.bmi.bund.de/Annex/en_14626/Download_Summary.pdf">Sussmuth
				  Commission report</xref>.</note> However, refugees and asylum seekers are not
			 the same as economic migrants. </p> 
		  <p>Economic migrants obtain entry to the UK on the basis of work
			 permits issued by the Home Office for skilled and unskilled jobs that need to
			 be filled. Previously this entry route was very restricted, but it has recently
			 been broadened by the Home Office's managed migration policy.<note>See 
				<xref url="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/news.asp?NewsID=101">David Blunkett's
				  House of Commons announcement on October 29th 2001 and the recent Home Office
				  White Paper 
				  <title>Secure Borders Safe Haven Integration with Diversity in
					 Modern Britain 2002</title></xref>. </note></p> 
		  <p>Asylum seekers claim safe haven from persecution. Refugees are
			 asylum seekers whose cases for safe haven have been accepted under the Refugee
			 Convention 1951 and relevant UK legislation. While refugees have an important
			 contribution to make to the economy, their claim to settle in the UK is based
			 on their reasons for flight from their country of origin, not on the skills
			 they bring to the host country, great though these may be. </p> 
		  <p>Little is currently known about the economic contribution of asylum
			 seekers and refugees in the UK as existing data sources generally fail to
			 distinguish between refugees and other migrant groups. Furthermore ethnic
			 monitoring categories<note>Eastern European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern
				populations are often not represented by the ethnic categories in official
				surveys.</note> and methods used by official data sources such as household
			 surveys often do not capture refugee populations adequately. However, recent
			 studies have produced conclusions as to the contribution of migrants<note>These
				reports identify migrants as those being born outside the UK. As the authors
				note in many cases, this definition has problems when it comes to identifying
				economic contributions of second-generation migrants. It also includes those
				who were born outside the UK but have been British citizens from birth.</note>
			 generally. A Home Office study<note><xref url="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/occ77migrant.pdf"><title>The migrant
					 population in the UK: fiscal effects</title></xref> by Ceri Gott and Karl
				Johnston [2002], RDS Occasional Paper No 77, Home Office. </note> published in
			 2002 estimates that migrants contributed £2.5bn more in taxes than they
			 consumed in benefits and services in 1999/2000. However, migrants are a
			 heterogeneous population and their labour market outcomes vary. Another Home
			 Office study has suggested that migrants from ethnic minority groups have
			 significantly lower levels of employment and wages than the UK-born population,
			 with different ethnic groups experiencing greater success in the labour market
			 than others.<note><xref url="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/occ82migrantuk.pdf"><title>Migrants

			 much to contribute to the UK economy.</p> 
		  <p>Recognition recently that refugees have a range of skills and
			 qualifications useful to the UK has led to a series of initiatives to record
			 them [see section on skills audits below]. NIACE research in 2001 involving
			 interviews with 70 respondents from 21 different countries living in Leicester
			 revealed a high level of education, skills and qualifications with the
			 intention of matching them to skills needs in the local area. A recent
			 programme developed by the 
			 <xref url="http://www.lda.gov.uk/mediaoffice/whatsnew/content/2_488.asp">London
				Framework for Regional Employment and Skills Action</xref> [FRESA] and the
			 London Skills Commission, targets London’s refugees to help fill the chronic
			 skills shortages in health and construction sectors. London Skills Commission
			 research revealed that refugees were often skilled in the very sectors that are
			 understaffed, which includes engineering and teaching as well as construction
			 and health. The NHS plans to recruit and retain more health care professionals,
			 estimating that it will need 45,000 extra health professionals over the next
			 five years to meet London’s rising demand for services. Similarly a
			 construction skills programme responds to the expected need for 10,000
			 construction staff ranging from qualified engineers to bricklayers to deliver
			 London’s key building projects. </p> 
		  <p>Studies have suggested that asylum seekers and refugees have higher
			 than average educational, skills and qualification levels, high levels of
			 motivation, and that the majority are young males of working age. Given these
			 characteristics, it is likely that, along with other categories of migrants,
			 refugees and asylum seekers have a great deal to offer their host country if
			 initial obstacles can be overcome. Unlike economic migrants, people seeking
			 asylum do not arrive in the UK ready to enter the labour market, but in need of
			 safe haven from persecution, and may have to overcome barriers such as trauma
			 of flight and exile, uncertainty of status and English language. However,
			 despite the lack of data that identifies the contribution of refugees and
			 asylum seekers as a group, the evidence on individual contributions to the UK
			 economy<note>For example<xref url="http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/downloads/rc_reports/credit.pdf"><title>Credit
					 to the Nation: A study of refugees in the United Kingdom</title></xref> by K.
				Knox [1997], Refugee Council, and Credit to the nation: refugee contributions
				to the UK, Refugee Council [2002].</note> suggest that these barriers need not
			 be insurmountable.</p> 
		  <p>On the basis of available data, it has also been concluded that
			 contrary to popular perceptions, migration does not have a significant impact
			 on overall unemployment amongst the existing UK population, including previous
			 migrant groups.<note><xref url="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/rdsolr0603.pdf"><title>The Local
					 Labour Market Effects of Immigration in the UK</title></xref> by Christian
				Dustmann, Francesca Fabbri, Ian Preston, Jonathan Wadsworth [February 2003].
				Home Office Online Report 06/03. It is important to note that deficiencies in
				the data sources used mean that these conclusions are tentative.</note>
			 Similarly, migration was not found to have an adverse effect on the wages of
			 the UK population, indeed if anything, immigration was found to have a positive
			 effect on the wages of the existing population. Findings from such research
			 accord with both international<note>See, for example, 
				<title>International Mobility of the Highly Skilled</title> by the
				OECD [January 2002]. </note> and European<note>See, for example, 
				<title>Immigration as an Economic Asset: the German
				  Experience</title> by S. Spencer [ed.] [1994], IPPR.</note> evidence on this
			 issue and have influenced the change of government policy on inward
			 migration.</p> 
		  <p>As of July 2002, asylum seekers are not permitted to work in the UK
			 until their claim for asylum has been approved. This constitutes a significant
			 barrier to any potential economic contribution they might make, both in terms
			 of its immediate restriction on employment but also in terms of the long-term
			 effects of periods of forced unemployment.</p><div type="box">

		  <div><head>What skills, qualifications and experience do refugees
			 have?</head> 
		  <p>Research into refugees and employment over the last 10 years has
			 suggested that asylum seekers and refugees have higher than average
			 educational, skills and qualification levels. But until recently, there has
			 been very little robust quantitative evidence for this. It is encouraging that
			 a series of initiatives has been developed to audit the skills and
			 qualifications of asylum seekers and refugees on a more systematic basis. This
			 is very welcome both because it will help refugees to find appropriate
			 employment and because many of them have skills and qualifications of which
			 there is a shortage in the UK. It has been a matter of concern to refugee
			 support organisations for some time that the UK has brought in foreign workers
			 to fill UK vacancies in sectors such as nursing and teaching, which refugees
			 could fill were they not frustrated by the obstacles to doing so.</p> 
		  <p>There have been a number of small-scale, local studies of refugee
			 and asylum-seeker skills. Others are in progress. Recent examples include those
			 commissioned by NIACE [Asylum seekers’ skills and qualifications audit pilot
			 project] which led the field in 2001, and more recently, the Eastern England
			 Consortium for Asylum Seeker Support’s [EECASS] 
		  <title>Pathways into Employment</title> feasibility study which maps
		  skills of refugees and asylum seekers and matches them to local jobs. Learning
		  and Skills Councils in London North, Coventry and Warwickshire, and Devon and
		  Cornwall have commissioned various studies of skills and qualifications, as
		  have Southampton City Council and Plymouth City Council.</p> 
		  <p>Assessments of skills within the Somali community include 
		  <title>The Professional Capacity of Nationals from the Somali Regions
			 in Britain</title> [Bloch and Atfield 2002] commissioned by Refugee Action and
		  IOM, and the report 
		  <title>Supporting the Somali Community in West London</title> that
		  analysed Somali skills levels in six west London boroughs. In 2000, the Refugee
		  Council and the BMA established a 
		  <xref url="http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/downloads/doctor database leaflet.pdf">database
			 of refugee doctors</xref> which now includes over 800 individuals. More
		  recently, the Refugee Council has also developed a dentists database in
		  association with the British Dental Association and this already contains 80
		  dentists.</p> 
		  <p><xref url="http://www.london.gov.uk/approot/mayor/refugees/docs/skills_rpt.pdf"><title>Missed
				  Opportunities: A skills audit of refugee women in London from the teaching,
				  nursing and medical professions</title></xref> [Dumper 2002] was commissioned
			 by the Greater London Authority, and contained a list of individuals
			 interviewed and ready to work. The LDA has recently commissioned a research
			 project that will identify the main skills, employment, enterprise and economic
			 development barriers and issues which prevent refugees and asylum seekers from
			 fully participating and contributing to the capital’s economy. The project will
			 make policy recommendations and establish a skills, qualifications and
			 employment baseline. Single borough skills audits are also in progress, such as
			 that in Hammersmith and Fulham.</p> 
		  <p>The report 
			 <xref url="http://www.lsc.gov.uk/news_docs/ASR ETE skills  services Cov  Warks Final report Apr 03.doc"><title>Asylum
				  seekers and refugees: education, training, employment, skills and services in
				  Coventry and Warwickshire</title></xref> [Phillimore et al 2003] was
			 commissioned by the Coventry and Warwickshire Learning and Skills Council and
			 undertaken by the University of Birmingham to follow up the knowledge gap in
			 the early NIACE report, and explore the emerging issues and possible solutions.
			 It recorded the skills and qualifications of 374 asylum seekers and refugees,
			 and contains information on broad range of employment-related issues similar to
			 the 
			 <xref url="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrep179.html">DWP
				research</xref> undertaken by Alice Bloch which also contains data on the
			 skills and qualifications of the asylum seekers and refugees interviewed in a
			 number of cities including Birmingham, Manchester, London, Newcastle, Leeds and
			 Sheffield.</p> 
		  <p>LSCs and others have statutory responsibilities to map the learning
			 and training needs in their local areas but it would be a pity if a series of
			 local, regional and specific skills and qualifications audits were
			 incompatible. The Home Office asylum and immigration research team administered
			 a postal skills audit of over-18 year olds who had been given refugee status
			 and Exceptional Leave to remain [ELR] during the period November 2002-January
			 2003. Recipients were offered a translated version of the questionnaire in six
			 languages, and it achieved a remarkable 66% response rate with over 2,000
			 replies. NARIC has assessed the equivalence of their qualifications and results
			 are likely to be available in June 2003. The Scottish Executive is carrying out
			 its own version of a skills audit using different methodology and with a
			 broader remit. This project seeks to identify the skills, qualifications and
			 aspirations of both asylum seekers and refugees, unlike the Home Office
			 version, and will also identify the barriers that refugees and asylum seekers
			 encounter when attempting to find employment or access further training.</p> 
		  <p>These two government-commissioned reports could introduce a more
			 standardised approach to skills auditing. The real issue is whether these
			 useful audits can be used effectively to improve the employment preparation
			 services offered to refugees, as a basis for needs assessment to help refugees
			 obtain employment more quickly, and at a level more suited to their skills and
			 qualifications, as well as benefiting the local and national economy by filling
			 skills.</p></div><div><head>Can refugee doctors fill vacancies for qualified
			 doctors in the NHS? </head> 
		  <p>The UK has recently been involved in campaigns to recruit overseas
			 professionals to fill gaps in the availability of qualified staff e.g. doctors,
			 teachers, nurses and IT specialists. But at the same time, qualified refugees
			 already settled in the UK and with the right to work have been unable to obtain
			 suitable jobs. Refugee Council and the British Medical Association [BMA] have a
			 database of 815 refugee doctors in the UK and a recent report published by the
			 Greater London Authority identified 75 refugee women doctors and other medical
			 professionals resident in London, the majority of whom were not

			 <p>It is too early to say whether the decision to withdraw the
				concession to work from asylum seekers who have not received a decision on
				their application after six months undermines the positive developments in the
				government approach to this issue [see key issue below].
				</p></div></div><div><head>Should asylum seekers be allowed to work while
			 waiting for decisions on their applications? </head> 
		  <p>In theory, allowing asylum seekers to work immediately upon their
			 arrival in the UK could save money for the taxpayer by reducing the financial
			 support needed to sustain them during their application period. However,
			 present government policies are based on the belief that being allowed to work
			 on arrival in the UK would act as an additional 'pull' factor in attracting
			 more asylum seekers and economic migrants posing as asylum seekers to the
			 UK.<note>See 
				<xref url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/cm011029/debtext/11029-05.htm">David
				  Blunkett's statement of 29th October 2001</xref>.</note></p> 
		  <p>This is why in July 2002 the government removed the concession
			 giving asylum seekers permission to work after they have been waiting over six
			 months for a decision on their case. This decision was justified on the basis
			 that most decisions are now made within this initial six-month period. The
			 withdrawal of this concession was made with no consultation, engendering
			 protest from refugee agencies and organisations promoting refugee employment.
			 These organisations believe that employers, who have only recently begun to
			 understand the complicated documentation arrangements which allow asylum
			 seekers to work, will become confused once more, and might overlook
			 applications from those with refugee status for fear of contravening asylum and
			 immigration legislation. Such organisations also maintain that given the
			 lengthy appeals process and the fact that many initial decisions may still not
			 be made within six months, exclusion from the labour market may affect
			 processes of integration. Many organisations also suggest that the public and
			 asylum seekers themselves support the notion that, where possible, asylum
			 seekers should be given the opportunity to provide for themselves and
			 contribute to the economy.<note>See for example, the response of 
				<xref url="http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/news/july2002/relea077.htm">the Refugee
				  Council</xref>.</note></p> 
		  <p>A significant percentage of asylum seekers [25-30% over recent
			 years] will eventually be given refugee or ELR status. There is evidence that
			 obtaining employment helps asylum seekers to settle in the host country, to
			 improve English language skills, to interact socially, to fulfil the wish to
			 contribute to their adopted country, and to support their families. It may also
			 reduce the mental health problems resulting from war, trauma, family disasters
			 and the problems of flight and exile.<note>See for example the findings of a
				recent report on migrants, 
				<xref url="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/rdsolr0703.pdf"><title>The labour
					 market outcomes and psychological well-being of ethnic minority migrants in
					 Britain</title></xref> by M. Shields and S. Wheatley Price [2002]. Home Office
				Online Report 07/03.</note> However, some asylum seekers will not be able to
			 work on arrival, and they should not be penalised for this. These include heads
			 of families who need to settle children in school, those suffering from health
			 or mental health problems or the effects of torture, and people with no English
			 language skills.</p> 
		  <p>If the average time taken to reach an asylum decision falls below
			 six months, and if new government integration policies introduce substantial
			 induction and English language programmes - and with them a sense of purpose -
			 into this waiting period, then the issue of early concessions to work may
			 become less pressing. Effective arrangements to encourage asylum seekers to do
			 voluntary work during the asylum period would certainly mitigate the possible
			 ill effects of the withdrawal of the concession and EECASS is carrying out
			 research on pathways into volunteering for asylum seekers. The Refugee Council
			 will produce a report on the effects of the withdrawal of the concession in
			 autumn 2003.</p></div><div><head>How has the removal of the concession to work
			 affected asylum seekers? </head> 
		  <p>The concession to work given to asylum seekers after six months in
			 the UK if their case had not yet been decided by the Home Office was withdrawn
			 by an announcement made in the House of Commons in July 2002. As stated above,
			 this move provoked concern from agencies working with refugees and asylum
			 seekers as it was thought that this would confuse employers, increase poverty
			 and dependency on the state, and have an adverse effect on future integration
			 into the job market, as prolonged periods of unemployment may impact on
			 motivation and mental health whilst contributing to the deskilling of
			 professionals. Several refugee agencies and researchers are beginning to
			 monitor the effect of this move on asylum seeking and refugee populations and
			 ICAR will report on the findings of these initiatives as soon as they become
			 available. In the meantime, it has been noted that the removal of the
			 concession to work has impacted on the assistance that voluntary agencies in
			 receipt of EU funding [particularly the European Social Fund [ESF] can offer
			 asylum seekers. The departments responsible for administering the ESF grants
			 have ruled that asylum seekers are no longer eligible for ESF-funded courses as
			 they can no longer be granted permission to work in the UK [see projects and
			 initiatives section below]. </p></div><div><head>Why is there a high level of
			 unemployment among refugees? </head> 
		  <p>The evidence suggests that refugees are the most unemployed and
			 underemployed group in the UK and that asylum seekers with permission to work
			 conceded after six months have especially high unemployment levels. A number of
			 recent studies have identified the barriers to obtaining employment, both as
			 perceived by refugees and by employers. Even so, the available evidence does
			 not make it possible to conclude which of a number of factors is the most
			 significant.</p>

			 <p>The most recent contribution to this debate comes from a research
				project commissioned by the DfES, and managed by the DWP, whose findings were
				published at the end of 2002.<note><xref url="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrep179.html"><title>Refugees'
						opportunities and barriers in employment and training</title></xref> by Alice
				  Bloch [2002], Department for Work and Pensions Research Report 179.</note> This
				project found that of the 400 asylum seekers and refugees surveyed, only 29%
				were working at the time of the survey. This study identified the barriers to
				employment as perceived by respondents and also highlighted the variable
				socio-demographic factors affecting individuals' likelihood of being
				employed.</p> 
			 <p>The main barrier to employment cited by respondents was English
				language and literacy proficiency although lack of UK work experience was also
				considered to be a major obstacle. Barriers were experienced differentially by
				respondents at different stages of settlement in the UK. Whilst lack of
				familiarity with the UK system was mentioned by many of those who had been in
				the UK for less than five years, this barrier was perceived to be less of a
				problem by those who had been resident in the UK for longer. For this group,
				racial discrimination was perceived to be more of a barrier to participation in
				the labour market.</p> 
			 <p>In analysing the social and demographic characteristics of
				individuals in relation to their employment experiences, the report concluded
				that although the length of residence had an impact on employment outcomes as
				suggested by previous research,<note><title>The Settlement of Refugees in
					 Britain</title> by Carey-Wood, Duke, Karn, and Marshall [1995]. Home Office
				  Research Study 141, Home Office Research and Planning Unit.</note> the factor
				determining labour market activity was actually English language proficiency.
				Receiving training in the UK also positively influenced the likelihood of
				employment. However, it is not clear whether the training led to employment in
				a causal manner, or whether those who had accessed training were ready to enter
				the labour market already. </p> 
			 <p>In the focus groups held as part of the research, the issue of
				local labour markets was also suggested as being a key element in determining
				employment opportunities, as areas with service sector jobs were seen to offer
				greater employment opportunities for refugees. This was perhaps reflected in
				the regional variations in the employment rates of the survey respondents:
				respondents in Leeds, Sheffield and London were more likely to be employed.
				Other studies have also pointed to the fact that dispersal may have affected
				the employment prospects of asylum seekers as their search for employment is
				restricted to areas accessible from their homes in the dispersal
				area.<note><title>Exploring mechanisms for the integration of asylum seekers

				work. Furthermore, many women in exile suffer from the loss of support systems
				from family and friends and the informal childcare arrangements that these
				provide.</p> 
			 <p>In addition to unemployment, occupational downgrading is also
				reported as a characteristic of refugee employment by refugee agencies offering
				training and preparation for employment [Refugee Council/TES, WUS/RETAS,
				Praxis, Refugees into Jobs]. Reports published by the DWP, the Greater London
				Authority and the Refugee Council that provide data on individuals' occupations

			 <p>The research evidence makes it clear that asylum seekers with
				permission to work have generally suffered from all the barriers to employment
				encountered by refugees, with the additional problem of uncertainty of status.
				Employers are uncertain whether they have the right to work and how long they
				will stay in the UK. Asylum seekers may in turn be demotivated by uncertainty
				and/or be barred from government employment training opportunities by their
				status. These problems are likely to be exacerbated by the removal of the
				concession to work for asylum seekers, as not only will new arrivals be
				excluded from the labour market altogether, but those who retain the concession
				to work may suffer from employer confusion surrounding the
				changes.</p></div></div><div><head>Why is English language such a big issue?
			 </head> 
		  <p>The acquisition of English language is one of the indices of
			 integration for refugees, although levels are likely to be self-assessed.

		  <p>Until the other recognised obstacles identified above are removed by
			 improved policy and job preparation services, there is insufficient evidence to
			 judge whether employers may be discriminating against refugees on racial
			 grounds. Studies of refugee perceptions of obstacles to employment invariably
			 identify racial prejudice as a significant factor. Employers on the other hand,
			 identify key problems as confusing permission to work documentation, the
			 negative public image of refugees and the lack of familiarity and comparability
			 of qualifications and work experience. These obstacles may appear as racial
			 prejudice to the unsuccessful refugee job seeker.</p></div><div><head>How do
			 refugees experience job seeking in the UK?</head> 
		  <p>Research suggests that the means and strategies for finding

			 differ according to length of residence and proficiency in English. Informal
			 personal contact seems to be the most common means of job seeking and gaining
			 advice on employment, although personal contacts are more likely to be made
			 through friends rather than kinship networks, which were commonly used in
			 countries of origin.<note><xref url="http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/downloads/rc_reports/progression_routes.pdf"><title>Refugees

		  <p>Mainstream employment services are more likely to be used by those

			 more than Iraqis, respondents from Sri Lanka, Kosova or Turkey, but were less
			 likely than these other nationalities to have asked friends about employment
			 opportunities.<note><xref url="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrep179.html"><title>Refugees'

			 suggests that refugees and asylum seekers work under poor terms and conditions.
			 Of a selected sample of 400, one-quarter of those in work had temporary posts,
			 the majority not by choice but because they were unable to find secure work.
			 The duration of such jobs was often quite short, with 25% for less than six
			 months. Nearly a third of both men and women were working part-time, half of
			 these because they were unable to find full-time work. Nearly half of those
			 working were working unsociable hours, before 8.30 in the morning and after
			 6.30 in the evening at least twice a week. Less than half of the refugees
			 employed were entitled to holiday pay and only a third had been offered
			 training in their job. The research concluded that in comparison with the wider
			 ethnic minority population, refugees experience greater job insecurity and have
			 fewer entitlements in the work place. Importantly, refugees were also found to
			 be earning on average 79% of what ethnic minorities in the UK on average earn
			 per hour. More than one-tenth was earning less than the National Minimum wage.
			 However, there was a notable disparity between the five communities involved in
			 the research. Even though Tamils were the most likely to be employed and
			 Somalis were the least likely to have a job, the Tamils in the survey had the
			 lowest average hourly rate whilst the Somalis had the highest.</p></div>

				and Canada there is very little statistical data about refugees and asylum

				highlighted in a number of recent reports.<note><xref url="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/occ67-migration.pdf"><title>Migration

			 <p>However these information gaps are increasingly being addressed.
				The Home Office Immigration and Nationality Department has a research programme
				attached to its integration policy and is considering ways of recording the
				skills and qualifications of asylum applicants. As part of this, the
				Immigration Research and Statistics Service [IRSS] has recently conducted a
				postal survey on the skills, qualifications and English language competency of
				people granted refugee status and ELR. This is the largest ever skills audit of
				this group and data collated from the survey will contribute to creating an
				employment and education profile of this group in the UK. Other local and
				regional skills audits have also been initiated in response to this information
				deficit [see <xref from="p4_ng002_05" rend="internal">projects and initiatives section</xref> below]. The Home Office
				Immigration Research and Statistics Service is currently examining the
				feasibility of using its audit to create a baseline for a longitudinal
				survey.</p> 
			 <p>Estimates of unemployment levels have often used the Home Office
				research published in 1995<note><title>The settlement of refugees in
					 Britain</title> Carey-Wood by Duke et al [1995]. Home Office Research Study
				  141.</note> as the best available source of data on this issue. It was based on
				a sample of 263 and took place before the introduction of Section 8 of the
				Immigration and Asylum Act, which both employers and refugees perceive as a
				barrier to employment. This study showed that only 27% of those seeking work
				were employed. Subsequent government-published research<note><xref url="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrep179.html"><title>Refugees'
						opportunities and barriers in employment and training</title></xref> by Alice
				  Bloch [2002], Department for Work and Pensions Research Report 179.</note> has
				found that on the basis of a survey of 400 refugees and asylum seekers from
				five different countries, living in five regions in England and who had been in
				the UK for different lengths of time, the level of labour market activity was
				very low indeed. Only 29% of refugees were working at the time of the survey
				compared with 60% of the ethnic minority population as calculated using Labour
				Force Survey data. Within this sample, men were more likely to be employed than
				women, with only 15% of women being in paid employment compared to 42% of men.
				There were also differences in employment by country of origin. Tamils were the
				group most likely to be working, with 36% of these respondents in employment at
				the time of the survey, whilst Somalis were much less likely to have a job,
				with only 16% of respondents employed. </p> 
			 <p>The unemployment rate among asylum seekers still awaiting
				decisions on their applications but with permission to work is higher but there
				are few statistics. The report published by DWP<note><xref url="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrep179.html"><title>Refugees'
						opportunities and barriers in employment and training</title></xref> by Alice
				  Bloch [2002], Department for Work and Pensions Research Report 179.</note>
				found that 25% of those with temporary admission were employed compared to 31%
				of those with secure status [ILR, refugee status, citizenship]. The Peabody
				Trust and the London Research Centre found, on the basis of a sample of 236
				London-based interviewees that there was 68% unemployment among asylum seekers
				and 42% unemployment among refugees. Taken together, 51% of those seeking work
				were unemployed.<note><title>Refugee Skills Net: the employment and training of
					 skilled and qualified refugees</title> by R. Barer [June 1999]. Peabody Trust
				  and London Research Centre.</note></p> 
			 <p>These studies echo the findings of other recent small-scale
				studies that found similarly high unemployment rates. For example, studies in
				1997 found that of the groups surveyed, 73% were unemployed, 85% had never
				succeeded in getting employment<note><title>Refugee Skills Analysis</title> by
				  the North London TEC [1997].</note> and at least 75% were unemployed after 2
				years.<note><title>Developments to Assist Refugees and Asylum Seekers towards

				London were unemployed.<note><title>Labour market information for Objective 3

		  <p><hi rend="bold">Home Office White Paper proposals</hi></p> 
		  <p>This White Paper, published on February 7th 2002, contains proposals
			 for a coherent strategy on nationality, immigration and asylum policy. It
			 responds to recent events including on the one hand September 11th 2001 and on
			 the other, evidence that the UK, like most of Western Europe, needs to import
			 skilled and unskilled labour to fill current and future job vacancies. It
			 confronts the challenges of active citizenship in a global economy, the need
			 for public confidence in effective management of migration and the asylum
			 process, and the need to integrate those who settle in the UK in a way that
			 promotes both their interests and social cohesion. Within this broad context,
			 the following proposals are relevant to refugees and employment:</p> 
		  <list> 
			 <item><xref url="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/news.asp?NewsID=101">Managed migration
				  proposal</xref> as per October 29th 2001 House of Commons announcement, not

				  the Integration Strategy: Full and Equal Citizens - a Strategy for the
				  Integration of Refugees into the United Kingdom</xref> [November 2000] which
				seeks to identify and spread good practice in integration through the National
				Refugee Integration Forum and its subgroups. The Employment, Training and Adult
				Education sub group is identifying barriers to employment.</item> 
			 <item>Continuation of Department of Education and Skills [DfES] new
				curriculum for the teaching of English for Speakers of Other Languages
				[ESOL].</item> 
			 <item>Development of effective mentoring schemes to help refugees
				find employment.</item> 
			 <item>Possible use of entitlement cards to provide a means of

				of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1996 and to reduce scope for fraudulent
				identification.</item> 
			 <item>Facilitation of employment of refugees by distinguishing them
				from illegal workers against whom various penalties are strengthened.</item> 
		  </list> 
		  <p>Since the publication of the White Paper, the concession to work for
			 asylum seekers that have not received a decision on their case after six months
			 was withdrawn by an announcement made in the House of Commons in July

				<cell role="projSubtit"></cell> 
				<cell role="projDesc">The ESF EQUAL Fund will allocate 365 million
				  Euros [£233 million] to the UK over years 2000-2006. Seven of its eight themes
				  are defined in the context of the four pillars of the European Employment
				  Strategy and the eighth covers the specific needs of asylum seekers. EQUAL
				  operates by bringing key partners in a geographical area together in
				  Development Partnerships [DPs]. Information on all Development Partnerships
				  [DPs] can be accessed via the Equal Common Database [ECBD]. There are currently
				  45 asylum seekers' DPs, each of which has to involve at least one EU partner
				  who is leading an EQUAL DP. Action 1 plans were approved by member states in
				  November 2001. Action 2, covering two or three years, started on May 15th 2002.
				  The EQUAL Asylum Seekers European Thematic Group [ASETG] are prioritising
				  employment and training issues and is developing a workplan which will include
				  a number of European meetings in 2003-4 where EQUAL projects can meet to debate
				  these issues. It is important to note that the recent Home Office ruling that
				  removes the concession to work for asylum seekers who have not received a
				  decision on their case after six months renders many asylum seekers ineligible
				  for support from the ESF. However, the EQUAL information note of December 2002
				  states that asylum seekers may still be eligible for a certain level of EQUAL
				  support, but only under Theme 1. This support, it states, should focus on
				  enabling asylum seekers to play a more active role in society, and to enable
				  those who are subsequently granted leave to stay to make a more rapid
				  transition to the labour market. The note advises that intensive levels of
				  support should only be provided after positive decisions have been made.</cell>

				  work which makes effective use of their skills and experience, maximises their
				  potential and provides an income for individuals and families. Its work is
				  aimed primarily at people who have been given positive decisions on their
				  asylum applications by the Home Office, but also takes into account the needs
				  of asylum seekers before decisions are taken. Its membership is drawn from key
				  stakeholders in the voluntary, public and private sectors. The Forum is in the
				  process of drafting a document called Welcome to Britain that will contain
				  information on employment and training in the UK and be included in a pack sent
				  out to those receiving refugee status.</cell>

				<cell role="projDesc">1, 200 mainly Iraqi Kurds and a few Iranians
				  from the Red Cross camp in Sangatte were given Exceptional Leave to Enter for
				  four years and given GV3 forms allowing them to work in that period. These new
				  entrants are being processed by JobCentre Plus Personal Advisers. The DWP has
				  been involved in ensuring the route into employment is as straightforward as
				  possible and has issued National Insurance numbers to those arriving from
				  Sangatte. Special arrangements were made with banks in order to set up accounts
				  for individuals. English language, literacy, numeracy, and employment skills
				  assessments were made on arrival. All individuals have a CV and are interviewed
				  regularly on a one to one basis to help with information on, for example,
				  interviews or financial assistance for travel. The time limit on assistance
				  from the Home Office was 15 March, although this may have been extended. It is
				  possible that lessons learned from this intake could be transferred to the
				  asylum process in the future, but very little English language provision has
				  been available and few have found jobs so far.</cell>
