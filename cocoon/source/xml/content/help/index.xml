                <p> The keyword index allows users to search for keywords that have been
                    assigned to items within <hi rend="bold">ncse</hi> using a combination of
                    controlled and free-text entry fields.  The index was compiled by first
                    algorithmically and manually applying keywords to articles in the <hi rend="italic">ncse</hi>
                    corpus.  The outputs of these processes were then aggregated, and indexed using the high-performance 
                    text search engine Lucene.  Persons, places, institutions, and subjects were generated by processing
                    the <hi rend="italic">uncorrected</hi> OCR output housed in the facsimile repository using a variety
                    of data mining and natural language processing techniques.  Image descriptors were manually applied to articles
                    within the corpus using a controlled vocabulary.   The index represents approximately 317,402 items within
                    the facsimile repository, including titles, articles, advertisements, front matter, and images.

                    This section describes how to enter
                    search terms and refine search queries, and how to interpret and refine search
                    results. It <hi rend="bold">does not</hi> describe how to search the full-text

                    <head>Free-text Entry Search Fields</head>
                    <p>To search for Persons, Places or Institutions, select the keyword type
                        from the drop down menu of the corresponding field, and then key in text. Multi-word terms may be entered in full (e.g. John
                        Smith), or in a partial form (e.g. Smith). </p>

                        <head>Multiple Terms in One Search Box</head>
                        <p>Multiple terms typed into one search box are automatically interpreted as
                            a Boolean AND, and are treated as separate queries. If conducting a Boolean search using different operators
                            (e.g. OR, NOT), enter terms into separate search boxes.  Boolean terms entered directly into the search fields will result in zero results being returned.</p>

                        <p>By default, queries entered using the free-text fields are compared to the
                            keyword index based on an exact match  to the terms entered.  However, the
                            user can select a percentage to request that search terms be matched that are of higher
                            or lower degrees of similarity to the terms indexed in the database.  Entering a higher percentage (e.g. 90%) will return
                            matches that are very similar to the entered text, while entering a lower percentage (e.g. 50%) will return results that
                            are much less similar to the entered text.

                        <p>As an alternative to approximate matching, use an asterisk (*)  or question mark (?) to broaden search results. You can use wildcard searches in the middle of a term , however
                         wildcard symbol cannot be the first character of a search term.</p>
                        
                        <p> Use an asterisk (*) to search for different words beginning with the same stem.  </p>

                                    e.g. place: <hi rend="italic">waterl*</hi> will match waterloo and waterlow (a possible result based on OCR output). </item>

                        <p>The question mark (?) performs a single character wildcard search, and will return variants of the

                    Subject and Image descriptors are searched by selecting terms from a controlled
                    vocabulary, or "thesaurus".  To select a term, choose a vocabulary and then click the vocabulary icon next to the input field. This will launch a pop-up window that displays the entire
                   hierarchical controlled vocabulary.  Navigate through the hierarchy by expanding and contracting classes.  To select a term, click the checkbox appearing
                    next to it, and then press the 'Insert' button that appears in the bottom of the window.  
Your term will appear in the search form.  
                    You may select more than one term from different points in the hierarchy; these will be joined during the search with a Boolean AND.
To close the vocabulary, click the 
                    close button at the bottom of the window.</p>

                        To generate fewer search results, add additional terms to the query.  For instance the query

                    <p>
                        To broaden search results, use the OR operator.  For instance to find all articles with occurrences of oxford university or cambridge university construct the following query.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Example: 
                        <list>
                            <item>
                               institution: <hi rend="italic">oxford university </hi> <hi rend="bold">AND</hi>  institution: <hi rend="italic">cambridge university </hi></item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        A NOT search can be used to filter items from results. For example to distinguish between the person Darwin, and the place Darwin, construct the following query.    
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <list>

                    <p>Results may be sorted according to publication date, by publication title, or by relevance.  The default sorting criterion is by relevance,
                        a scoring mechanism used within the underlying search engine, Lucene.  Within Lucene, relevance is determined by how many times a query term
                        appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all documents in the index.
                        When sorting by date, results are ordered by year, month, and then day. Sorting by publication results in items that are ordered according to the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> publication title for the issue in which they occur,
                        in ascending order.

                        and a panel containing keywords that have been assigned to the item.  
	       View the keywords by clicking the '+' sign next to each item. </p>
	    <p>Within the panel that displays, keywords of each type (persons, places, institutions, subjects and images) are alphabetically arranged, and
include the frequency with which they appear in the item.  Each keyword is also a link.</p>

	<head>Browsing</head>
	<p>Browsing indexes have been created out the hierarchical schemes used to assign
	    controlled subject and image descriptors to items in the facsimile repository.
	    Subjects have been automatically assigned using the <title>UCREL Semantic
		Analysis System (USAS)</title>tagset; Image descriptors have been manually
	    assigned using an adapted form of the <title>Database of Mid-Victorian
		Illustration (DMVI)</title> To learn more about these controlled
	    vocabularies and the process used to assign keywords, please read the <xref
		type="internal" from="p1_2">Technical Introduction</xref>.</p>
	    <p>Begin browsing by selecting a top-level term from the chosen vocabulary. When a term is selected, the items in the corpus assigned the term will be displayed.  Items are ordered by relevance, a scoring mechanism used within the underlying search engine, Lucene.  Within Lucene, relevance is determined by how many times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all documents in the index.   
</p><p>To the right of the intermediate results, the hierarchy will display.  Use the tree display to navigate and combine terms from different sections of the hierarchy in order to narrow the search results returned.  Terms added to queries may be removed by clicking the 'x' symbol next to the term as displayed in the search results summary.</p> 
<p>For example, to find <hi rend="bolditalic">images of children at the sea</hi>, browse by image as follows: </p>
<p><list><item>Settings <hi rend="bold">NARROWED TO</hi> Natural environments &gt; The sea <hi rend="bold">COMBINED WITH</hi> People &gt; Figures &gt; Children
    </item>
</list>
</p>
<p>To search for items about <hi rend="bolditalic">war activities at sea</hi>, try the following query:</p>
<p><list><item>Government &amp; the Public Domain <hi rend="bold">NARROWED TO</hi> Warfare, defence and the army; weapons <hi rend="bold">COMBINED WITH</hi>    Movement, Location, Travel &amp; Transport &gt; Sailing, swimming, etc.
    </item>
</list>
</p>
                <p><hi rend="bolditalic">Tip:</hi> The keyword index includes over a million terms from the subject hierarchy.  Combine terms to return a manageable resultset.</p>
